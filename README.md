# phase-1-mars-weather-app

## about

A weather app for the people of Mars! This single page application will fetch data from the [NASA Mars Rover API](https://api.nasa.gov/)
to display random pictures when the page loads. It will also use the [MAAS2 Rest API](https://maas2.apollorion.com/)
to populate the app with data including Sol, Season, Temperatures, Sunrise and Sunset, Atmosphere Opacity, Pressure, UV Irradiance, Humidity and Wind Speed.
The user will also be able to choose between Farenheit and Celsius to view the temperature.
The corresponding date on earth will also appear for the user.
